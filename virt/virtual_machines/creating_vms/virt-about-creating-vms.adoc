You can create virtual machines (VMs) from operating system images provided by Red Hat, such as {op-system-base-full}, Fedora, or CentOS. You can also create VMs from a custom operating system image, such as Ubuntu.

== Creating VMs from Red Hat images

You can create virtual machines (VMs) from operating system images provided by Red Hat by using one of the following data sources:

* Template
* Instance type
* `VirtualMachine` manifest

Red Hat images are xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/creating_vms/virt-about-creating-vms.adoc#virt-about-golden-images_virt-about-creating-vms[golden images]. They are published as container disks in a secure registry.

The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) polls and imports the container disks into your cluster and stores them in the `openshift-virtualization-os-images` project as snapshots or persistent volume claims (PVCs).

Add link when storage section is created
// Red Hat images are automatically updated. You can disable and re-enable automatic updates for these images. See Managing Red Hat boot source updates.

== Creating VMs from custom images

You can create virtual machines (VMs) from custom operating system images by using one of the following methods:

* Importing the image as a container disk from a registry.
// +
// You can configure automatic updates for container disks. See Managing custom boot source updates.
// Uncomment when storage section is done

* Importing the image from a web page.
* Uploading the image from a local machine.
* Clone a persistent volume claim (PVC) that contains the image.

The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) imports the image into a PVC by using a data volume. You add the PVC to the VM by using the {product-title} web console or command line.

[NOTE]
====
After you create the VM, you must install the QEMU guest agent on the VM.

The QEMU guest agent is included with Red Hat images.
