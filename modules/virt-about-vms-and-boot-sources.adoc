= About VMs and boot sources

Virtual machines (VMs) consist of a VM definition and one or more disks that are backed by data volumes. VM templates enable you to create VMs using predefined specifications.

Every template requires a boot source, which is a fully configured disk image including configured drivers. Each template contains a VM definition with a pointer to the boot source. Each boot source has a predefined name and namespace. For some operating systems, a boot source is automatically provided. If it is not provided, then an administrator must prepare a custom boot source.

Provided boot sources are updated automatically to the latest version of the operating system. For auto-updated boot sources, persistent volume claims (PVCs) are created with the cluster's default storage class. If you select a different default storage class after configuration, you must delete the existing data volumes in the cluster namespace that are configured with the previous default storage class.

To use the boot sources feature, install the latest release of {VirtProductName}. The namespace `openshift-virtualization-os-images` enables the feature and is installed with the {VirtProductName} Operator. Once the boot source feature is installed, you can create boot sources, attach them to templates, and create VMs from the templates.
